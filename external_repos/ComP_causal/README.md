## 📖 Introduction

### Motivation

Although great progress has been made, current IMER methods still suffer from severe modality imbalance problem that hinders better performance. Specifically, such a problem can be summarized as:
1. **Modality performance gap**, *i.e.*, performances of different modalities vary greatly
2. **Modality under-optimization**, *i.e.*, modality-specific performance degrades after multi-modal co-training.

### Method

 To address this issue, we devise a novel **C**r**o**ss-**m**odal **P**rompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. 
 
 Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output. Additionally, a coordinator is employed to dynamically re-weight the modality outputs as a complement to the balance strategy to improve the model's efficacy.

## 🚀 Run the Code

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8.20
- PyTorch == 1.12.0
- numpy == 1.24.3
- sklearn == 1.3.2

### Data preparation

Download data from [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12BQqjJlhBltCncMHC8_tzw) (**Code:gjqh**) and modify the corresponding paths in the `config.py` file.

Data should be stored as follows:
```
data
├── CMUMOSI
│   ├── features
│   ├── CMUMOSI_features_raw_2way.pkl
├── CMUMOSEI
│   ├── features
│   ├── CMUMOSEI_features_raw_2way.pkl
├── IEMOCAP
    ├── features
    ├── IEMOCAP_features_raw_4way.pkl
    ├── IEMOCAP_features_raw_6way.pkl
```

### Train models
You can train the model with data at different missing rates by running `train_mr.py`. Here is an example:
```
python -u ComP/train_mr.py --dataset=CMUMOSI --audio-feature=wav2vec-large-c-UTT 
    --text-feature=deberta-large-4-UTT --video-feature=manet_UTT --seed=66 --batch-size=32 
    --epoch=300 --lr=0.0001 --hidden=256 --depth=4 --num_heads=2 --drop_rate=0.5 
    --attn_drop_rate=0.0 --stage_epoch=150 --gpu=2 --mask_rate=0.7 --lbd=0.3
```
